            <h3>A kaleidoscope of cool</h3>
            Discover the spectacular spectrum of sharks! There are over 500 species, from angel to
            zebra. Some are speedy, some are slow. Many feast on fish, while others prefer to slurp
            worms or filter plankton. Their ancestors swam the seas before dinosaurs roamed the
            land. Today, many populations are threatened — and face an uncertain future.
            <h3>All about sharks</h3>
            <p>
              What makes a shark a shark? Some sharks are large, others are itty bitty. Some are
              well-known, while many others remain less familiar. Though in popular culture sharks
              are large, toothy creatures to be feared, this is not always the case. In fact, many
              sharks around the world need protection so they can help maintain a healthy ocean for
              generations to come.
            </p>
            <p>All sharks share these important characteristics:</p>
            <span> Soft skeletons No bones? </span>
            <p>
              No bones? No problem! Instead of the hard bones that make up the human skeleton,
              sharks have softer skeletons made of cartilage — similar to what we have in our noses
              and ears.
            </p>
            <span> Five to seven gill-slits </span>
            <p>
              Sharks have five to seven gill-slits on each side of their body. Gills are a shark’s
              respiratory organ – gases are exchanged with the water that flows over them. In its
              simplest form, oxygen is absorbed and carbon dioxide is released.
            </p>
            <span> Fins for swimming, steering and balance </span>
            <p>
              Sharks swim using their caudal fin — which is sometimes called the tail fin. Sharks
              generate swimming power by moving their caudal fin from side to side. Pectoral fins,
              found on a shark's side behind the gills, are used for lift and steering. The dorsal
              fin is used for balance: it keeps the shark upright and stabilized, preventing it from
              rolling or spinning.
            </p>
            <span> Teeth that regrow </span>
            <p>
              A shark's teeth fall out throughout its life and are continually replaced — this is
              called “revolver dentition.”
